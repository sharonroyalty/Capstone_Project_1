## Metrics
![Average sales per product](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0c33c6f-cf90-4ea1-8530-041929a4f6a4)

-  High and Low-Performing Products:
   Products with a high average sales value indicate premium or high-demand items.
 -  Products with a low average sales are cheaper items or ones that are less popular.
    This helps identify which products are driving more revenue per sale and those that may need better marketing or promotions.

 -  Product Mix Optimization:
   By understanding which products have higher average sales, we can adjust the inventory and focus on stocking items with high profitability, potentially phasing out or reducing stock for low-performing products.

 -   Customer Preferences:
  High average sales for specific products might indicate customer preferences or trends.
    Tracking these insights over time can help forecast demand, adapt to customer trends, and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.

    Identify South with the highest revenue, which often indicates strong brand presence, higher demand, or better sales channels.
    These region could be prioritized for additional marketing investment or new product launches.

     West Region with low revenue reveal that brand awareness or distribution could be improved.
    Analyzing factors like local competition, pricing differences, or logistical challenges in these regions can help develop targeted strategies to improve sales.
