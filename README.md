-  High and Low-Performing Products:
   Products with a high average sales value indicate premium or high-demand items.

    This helps identify which products are driving more revenue per sale and those that may need better marketing or promotions.

   By understanding which products have higher average sales, we can adjust the inventory and focus on stocking items with high profitability, potentially phasing out or reducing stock for low-performing products.
